# VBA-Challenge

The following files are located in the root folder of this repo
1. Multiple_year_stock_data.vbs - VBA script for the challenge
2. Results_20XX_screenshot.png - 3 separate files with screenshots of each sheet for years 2018-2020 after running the script
3. README.md - This file

Additional Notes
1. The VBA script includes 3 subroutines. The first (SummarizeStocks) only needs to be run as it will call the other two subroutines.
2. I used Miscrosoft Learn and StackOverflow to get information on the usage on the properties and methods for conditional formatting, number formatting, and column wdith autofitting.
